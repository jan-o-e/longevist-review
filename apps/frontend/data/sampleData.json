An intermediate level of visual organisation that has received less attention is the ''object constellation'', defined here as a familiar configuration of contextually-associated objects (e.g., plate + spoon). Recent work has shown that information from multiple objects can be integrated to support observers' high-level understanding of a ''scene''. Here we used EEG to test when the visual system integrates information across objects to support representations of real-world size. To this end, we briefly presented masked object constellations consisting of either large (e.g., chair + table) or small (e.g., plate + spoon) object silhouettes, while independently varying retinal size. As a control, observers also saw each object silhouette presented in isolation. Behavioural results showed that observers recognized the objects' real-world size more easily when the silhouettes appeared in pairs than when they appeared in isolation. Representational similarity analysis of EEG data revealed that neural activity patterns captured information about the real-world size of object constellations from ~200 ms after stimulus onset. This representation was stronger for, and specific to, object pairs as compared to single objects, and remained significant after regressing out visual similarity models derived from computational models. These results reveal the neural time course of real-world size extracted from familiar constellations of objects. More generally, they provide evidence for inter-object facilitation of visual processing, leading to a qualitatively different high-level representation of object pairs than single objects.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.01.543064","title":"Phylodynamics Uncovers the Transmission of Antibiotic-Resistant Escherichia coli between Canines and Humans in an Urban Environment","authors":"Walas, N.; Mu\u0308ller, N.

To elucidate this role, we utilized genomic sequencing and phylogenetics to characterize the burden and transmission dynamics of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (ABR-Ec) cultured from canine and human feces present on urban sidewalks in San Francisco, California. We collected a total of fifty-nine ABR-Ec from human (n=12) and canine (n=47) fecal samples from the Tenderloin and South of Market (SoMa) neighborhoods of San Francisco. We then analyzed phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance (ABR) of the isolates, as well as clonal relationships based on cgMLST and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the core genomes. Using Bayesian inference, we reconstructed the transmission dynamics between humans and canines from multiple local outbreak clusters using the marginal structured coalescent approximation (MASCOT). Overall, we found human and canine samples to carry similar amounts and profiles of ABR genes. Our results provide evidence for multiple transmission events of ABR-Ec between humans and canines. In particular, we found one instance of likely transmission from canines to humans as well as an additional local outbreak cluster consisting of one canine and one human sample. Based on this analysis, it appears that canine feces act as an important reservoir of clinically relevant ABR-Ec within the urban environment. Our findings support that public health measures should continue to emphasize proper canine feces disposal practices, access to public toilets and sidewalk and street cleaning.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.542793","title":"Spatial and temporal characterization of the rich fraction of plastid DNA present in the nuclear genome of Moringa oleifera reveals unanticipated complexity in NUPTs' formation","authors":"Marczuk-Rojas, J.

As a result, plant nuclear genomes are featured by a small, but variable, fraction of their genomes of plastid origin, the so-called nuclear plastid DNA sequences (NUPTs). However, research on the topic was mostly focused on a limited number of species and of plastid DNA. Here, we leveraged a chromosome-scale version of the Moringa oleifera genome, featured by the largest fraction of plastid DNA in any plant nuclear genome, to examine the chromosomal distribution and arrangement of NUPTs, to explicitly model and test the correlation between their age and size distribution, as well as to characterize their sites of origin at the chloroplast genome and their sites of insertion at the nuclear one. We found a bimodal distribution of NUPT relative ages, which implies NUPTs in moringa were formed through two separate events. Furthermore, NUPTs from every event showed markedly distinctive features, suggesting they originated through distinct mechanisms. Our results reveal an unanticipated complexity of the mechanisms at the origin of NUPTs and of the evolutionary forces behind their fixation and highlight moringa species as an exceptional model to study the mechanisms of origin and evolutionary fate of NUPTs.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542966","title":"Epidermal Growth Factor potentiates EGFR(Y992\/1173)-mediated therapeutic response of triple negative breast cancer cells to cold atmospheric plasma-activated medium","authors":"Wang, P.; Zhou, R.; Zhou, R.; Yu, L.; Zhao, L.; Li, W.; Lin, J.; Rajapakse, A.; Lee, C.-H.; Furnari, F.

We used CAP-activated media (PAM) to capture the multi-modal chemical species of CAP. Specific antibodies, small molecule inhibitors and CRISPR\/Cas9 gene-editing approaches showed an essential role for receptor tyrosine kinases, especially epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, in mediating triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell responses to PAM. EGF also dramatically enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of PAM against TNBC cells. Site-specific phospho-EGFR analysis, signal transduction inhibitors and reconstitution of EGFR-depleted cells with EGFR-mutants confirmed the role of phospho-tyrosines 992\/1173 and phospholipase C gamma signaling in upregulating levels of reactive oxygen species above the apoptotic threshold. EGF-triggered EGFR activation enhanced the sensitivity and selectivity of PAM effects on TNBC cells, such that a strategy based on the synergism of CAP and EGF therapy may provide new opportunities to improve the clinical management of TNBC.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543006","title":"Upregulation of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 by JC polyomavirus infection promotes immune recognition by natural killer cells.","authors":"Jost, S.; Ahn, J.; Chen, S.; Yoder, T.; Gikundiro, K.

In immunocompetent individuals, JCPyV chronic infection is asymptomatic and not associated with diseases. However, JCPyV causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a potentially fatal complication of severe immune suppression due to monoclonal antibody treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases and transplantation, or due to uncontrolled HIV infection. There is currently no effective treatment against PML and novel immunotherapies are urgently needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by JCPyV. The risk of developing PML increases with loss of immune control by JCPyV-specific T cells and antibodies. Natural killer (NK) cells play critical roles in defense against viral infections, yet NK cell contribution to the control of JCPyV infection remains largely unexplored. Here, we first compared NK and T cell responses against JCPyV VP1 peptide pools. In about 40% of healthy donors, we detected robust CD107a upregulation and IFN-{gamma} production by NK cells, extending beyond T cell responses. Next, using a novel flow cytometry-based killing assay, we showed that co-culture of NK cells and JCPyV-infected astrocyte-derived SVG-A cells leads to a 60% reduction in infection, on average. Expression of ligands for the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D was modulated in JCPyVinfected cells, with overall enhanced expression of ULBP2. To evaluate the impact of NKG2D triggering on NK cell-mediated elimination of JCPyV-infected cells, we performed co-cultures in the presence of NKG2D blocking antibodies, which resulted in decreased NK cell degranulation. Altogether, these findings suggest NKG2D-mediated activation may play a key role in controlling JCPyV replication and may be a promising immunotherapeutic target to boost NK cell anti-JCPyV","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543102","title":"TERRA R-loops connect and protect sister telomeres in mitosis","authors":"Sze, S.; Bhardwaj, A.; FNU, P.; Azarm, K.; Mund, R.; Ring, K.; smith, s.","author_corresponding":"susan smith","author_corresponding_institution":"NYU SoM","date":"2023-06-02","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_no","category":"cell biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/02\/2023.05.31.543102.source.xml","abstract":"Resolution of cohesion between sister telomeres in human cells depends on TRF1-mediated recruitment of the polyADP-ribosyltransferase, tankyrase to telomeres. In cells where tankyrase is deleted or the tankyrase binding site in TRF1 is mutated, sister telomeres remain cohered in mitosis. Human aged cells and ALT cancer cells naturally exhibit persistent telomere cohesion due to shortened telomeres that do not recruit sufficient TRF1\/tankyrase for resolution. Persistent cohesion plays a protective role, but the mechanism by which sister telomeres remain cohered is not well understood. Here we show that telomere repeat containing RNA (TERRA) holds sister telomeres together through RNA-DNA hybrid (R-loop) structures. We show that a tankyrase-interacting partner, the RNA-binding protein C19orf43 is required for resolution of telomere cohesion and for repression of TERRA R-loops. Depletion of C19orf43 led to persistent telomere cohesion and an increase in TERRA R-loops. Overexpression of RNaseH1 counteracted persistent cohesion in C19orf43-depleted cells, as well as in aged and ALT cells. In fact, treatment of cohered telomeres in mitotic cells with RNaseH1 in situ, was sufficient to resolve sister telomere cohesion, confirming that RNA-DNA hybrids hold sister telomeres together. Consistent with a protective role for persistent telomere cohesion, depletion of C19orf43 in aged cells reduced DNA damage and significantly delayed replicative senescence. We propose that the inherent inability of shortened telomeres to recruit R-loop repressing machinery permits a controlled onset of senescence.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542983","title":"Genetic determinants of plasma protein levels in the Estonian population","authors":"Kalnapenkis, A.; Joeloo, M.; Lepik, K.; Kukuskina, V.; Kals, M.; Alasoo, K.; Ma\u0308gi, R.; Esko, T.; Vosa, U.; Andres Metspalu, Lili Milani, Mari Nelis, Georgi Hudjashov,  ","author_corresponding":"Anette Kalnapenkis","author_corresponding_institution":"Institute of Genomics, University of Tartu","date":"2023-06-02","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"genomics","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/02\/2023.05.30.542983.source.xml","abstract":"The proteome holds great potential as an intermediate layer between the genome and phenome.

Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist, using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky, as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored. Here, we ask the question: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks, and how modular are these communities? For this, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNA-seq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that (a) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that (b) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that (c) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542991","title":"Solvent based fractional biosynthesis, phytochemical analysis and biological activity of silver nanoparticles obtained from extract of Salvia moorcroftiana","authors":"Khan, M.; Khan, T.; Aasim, M.; Sherazi, T.

Three types of solvents; from polar to nonpolar, i.e., water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and hexane, were used to extract the plant as a whole and as well as in fractions. The biosynthesized silver nanoparticles in all extracts (except hexane-based extract) were spherical, smaller than 20 nm, polydispersed (PDI ranging between 0.2 and 0.5), and stable with repulsive force of action (average zeta value = -18.55{+\/-}1.17). The tested bacterial strains i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be sensitive to even small concentrations of AgNPs, especially P. aeruginosa. The antibacterial effect of these AgNPs was associated with their ability to generate reactive oxygen species. DMSO (in fraction) could efficiently extract antibacterial phytochemicals and showed activity against MDR bacteria (inhibition zone = 11-12 mm). Thus, the antibacterial activity of fractionated DMSO extract was comparable to that of AgNPs because it contained phytochemicals having solid antibacterial potential. Furthermore, AgNPs synthesized from this extract owned superior antibacterial activity. However, whole aqueous extract based AgNPs MIC was least (7-32 {micro}g\/mL) as compared to others.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543100","title":"NIRis: A low-cost, versatile imaging system for NIR fluorescence detection of phototrophic cell colonies used in science and education","authors":"Franz, O.; Ha\u0308kka\u0308nen, H.; Kovanen, S.; Heikkila\u0308-Huhta, K.; Nissinen, R.; Ihalainen, J.

By analyzing the viral genetic material present in wastewater, public health officials can gain early insights into the spread of the virus and inform timely intervention measures. The construction of reference datasets from known SARS-CoV-2 lineages and their mutation profiles has become state-of-the-art for assigning viral lineages and their relative abundances from wastewater sequencing data. However, the selection of reference sequences or mutations directly affects the predictive power. Here, we show the impact of a mutation- and sequence-based reference reconstruction for SARS-CoV-2 abundance estimation. We benchmark three data sets: 1) synthetic 'spike-in' mixtures, 2) German samples from early 2021, mainly comprising Alpha, and 3) samples obtained from wastewater at an international airport in Germany from the end of 2021, including first signals of Omicron. The two approaches differ in sub-lineage detection, with the marker-mutation-based method, in particular, being challenged by the increasing number of mutations and lineages. However, the estimations of both approaches depend on selecting representative references and optimized parameter settings. By performing parameter escalation experiments, we demonstrate the effects of reference size and alternative allele frequency cutoffs for abundance estimation. We show how different parameter settings can lead to different results for our test data sets, and illustrate the effects of virus lineage composition of wastewater samples and references. Here, we compare a mutation- and sequence-based reference construction and assignment for SARS-CoV-2 abundance estimation from wastewater samples. Our study highlights current computational challenges, focusing on the general reference design, which significantly and directly impacts abundance allocations.

A full P. falciparum genome was published in 2002, yet 44.6% of its genes have unknown functions. Improving functional annotation of genes is important for identifying drug targets and understanding the evolution of drug resistance. Results: Genes function by interacting with one another. So, analyzing gene co-expression networks can enhance functional annotations and prioritize genes for wet lab validation. Earlier efforts to build gene co-expression networks in P. falciparum have been limited to a single network inference method or gaining biological understanding for only a single gene and its interacting partners. Here, we explore multiple inference methods and aim to systematically predict functional annotations for all P. falciparum genes. We evaluate each inferred network based on how well it predicts existing gene-Gene Ontology (GO) term annotations using network clustering and leave-one-out cross-validation. We assess overlaps of the different networks' edges (gene co-expression relationships) as well as predicted functional knowledge. The networks' edges are overall complementary: 47%-85% of all edges are unique to each network. In terms of accuracy of predicting gene functional annotations, all networks yield relatively high precision (as high as 87% for the network inferred using mutual information), but the highest recall reached is below 15%. All networks having low recall means that none of them capture a large amount of all existing gene-GO term annotations. In fact, their annotation predictions are highly complementary, with the largest pairwise overlap of only 27%. We provide ranked lists of inferred gene-gene interactions and predicted gene-GO term annotations for future use and wet lab validation by the malaria community. Conclusions: The different networks seem to capture different aspects of the P. falciparum biology in terms of both inferred interactions and predicted gene functional annotations. Thus, relying on a single network inference method should be avoided when possible.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542960","title":"Minimal condition repetitions required in rapid serial visual presentation decoding paradigms","authors":"Grootswagers, T.","author_corresponding":"Tijl Grootswagers","author_corresponding_institution":"The MARCS Institute for Brain, Behaviour and Development","date":"2023-06-02","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc0_ng","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/02\/2023.05.30.542960.source.xml","abstract":"Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) decoding paradigms allow testing a greater number of conditions than was previously possible within short experimental sessions.

The sampling points contains 45 to be reclaimed samples and 100 existing classification land use types. 14 environmental factors including soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN) and other soil nutrients and terrain factors were extracted and calculated based on laboratory test and digital elevation map. Meanwhile, random forest classier was utilized to determine the post-mining land use based on GINI index and 14 environmental factors by using 100 existing classification land use types. 82 of 100 samples were utilized to build the model and the other 18 samples were utilized to validate the accuracy of the classification model. Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) techniques were utilized to determine the specific land use types in cropland, shrub and grassland. the random forest classier showed a great prediction capability, with only 1 miss-classified sample in the validation data-set, the accuracy of the classification model was 95%. Among the 45 samples to be reclaimed, 15 samples were classified into cropland, 23 samples were classified into shrub and grassland, 5 samples were classified into arbor land, 2 samples were classified into solar station. By using DBSCAN, the 58 samples classified into cropland in terms of the post-mining were separated into cluster 1 and 2, cluster 1 comprises 24 samples while cluster 2 comprises 34 samples. Among the 61 samples classified into shrubland and grassland, Cluster -1 comprises 24 samples and Cluster 0 comprise 22 samples. The results could provide technological support for land reclamation determination. The content of TN of C1 is 5 times more than C2 and 4 times more than C3. Also, the K valve of C1 column is maximum and over 0.4, which means the soil particle is relatively smaller and the soil texture of it is sandy loam. The TWI of C1 is minimum, in consideration of a positive valve of profile curvature and a negative valve of plan curvature. In terms of the 45 to be reclaimed samples, 15 samples were classified into C1, 23 samples were classified into C2, 5 samples were classified into C3, 2 samples were classified into C4. The valve of K and content of soil nutrients of the samples classified to be C1 column(C1-C) is maximum. Simultaneously, the slope steepness({degrees}) is below 5{degrees} and is perceived as gentle surface. Cluster 1 comprises 24 samples and the average content of TN, AP and SOM is 0.566g\/kg, 11.93mg\/kg and 19.975g\/kg respectively, while Cluster 2 comprises 34 samples and the average content of TN, AP and SOM is 0.304g\/kg, 3.12mg\/kg and 8.36g\/kg respectively.

In eukaryotes, there are two paralogs: DRG1 and DRG2, both of which have a conserved binding partner called DRG family regulatory protein 1 and 2 (DFRP1 and DFRP2), respectively. These binding partners are required for the function of DRGs, including their stabilisation at the protein level. Moreover, DFRPs interact with their respective DRG via a conserved region called the DFRP domain. Despite being highly similar, DRG1 and DRG2 have strict binding specificity for their respective DFRP. Using AlphaFold generated structure models of the human DRG\/DFRP complexes, we have biochemically characterised their interactions and identified interface residues involved in determining specificity. This analysis revealed that as few as five mutations in DRG1 can switch its binding from DFRP1 to DFRP2. We show how two DRG1 residues in the core of the interface are most important for specifying the interaction with DFRP1 over DFRP2. We also demonstrate that whilst DFRP1 can stimulate the GTPase activity of DRG1, DFRP2 binding cannot. Overall, this work provides new insight into the structural determinants responsible for the binding specificities of the DRG:DFRP translation factor complexes, which are known to be essential for normal development in mice and humans.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543065","title":"Formation of amyloid fibrils by the regulatory 14-3-3\u03b6 protein","authors":"Sulskis, D.; Ziaunys, M.; Sakalauskas, A.; Smirnovas, V.","author_corresponding":"Darius Sulskis Dr.","author_corresponding_institution":"Sector of Amyloid Research, Institute of Biotechnology, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University","date":"2023-06-02","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_no","category":"biochemistry","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/02\/2023.05.31.543065.source.xml","abstract":"The 14-3-3 is a highly conserved adaptor protein family with multi-layer functions, abundantly expressed in the brain.

Prior works on creating a microfluidic analogue to the electronic transistor could not replicate the transistor's saturation behavior, which is crucial to perform analog amplification and is fundamental to modern circuit design.

Analyzing complete genomes, we discovered that most Bacteroidota have the rfb operon fragmented into non-random gene-singlets and\/or doublets\/triplets, termed \"minioperons\". To reflect global operon integrity, duplication, and fragmentation principles, we propose a five-category (infra\/supernumerary) cataloguing system and a Global Operon Profiling System for bacteria. Mechanistically, genomic sequence analyses revealed that operon fragmentation is driven by intra-operon insertions of predominantly Bacteroides-DNA (thetaiotaomicron\/fragilis) and likely natural selection in specific micro-niches. Bacteroides-insertions, also detected in other antigenic operons (fimbriae), but not in operons deemed essential (ribosomal), could explain why Bacteroidota have fewer KEGG-pathways despite large genomes. DNA insertions overrepresenting DNA-exchange-avid species, impact functional metagenomics by inflating gene-based pathway inference and overestimating \"extra-species\" abundance.

This participatory programme, involving both national and local stakeholders, allowed to monitor from 2013 to 2019 the progression of the infection in three badger populations located in clusters covering between 3222 km2 and 7698 km2. In each cluster, badgers were trapped and tested for M. bovis. Our first aim was to describe the dynamics of the infection in these clusters. We developed a Bayesian model of the prevalence accounting for the spatial structure of the cases, the imperfect and variable sensitivity of the diagnostic tests, and the correlation of the infection status of badgers of the same commune caused by local factors (social structure, proximity to infected farms, etc.). This model revealed a prevalence increasing with time in one cluster (Dordogne\/Charentes), decreasing in the second cluster (Burgundy), and remaining stable in the third cluster (Bearn). In all clusters, the infection was strongly spatially structured, whereas the mean correlation between the infection status of two animals trapped in the same commune was negligible. Our second aim was to develop indicators for the monitoring of the M. bovis infection by stakeholders of the programme. We used the fitted model to estimate, in each cluster, (i) the mean prevalence level at mid-period, and (ii) the proportion of the badger population becoming infected in one year. We then derived two indicators of these two key quantities from a much simpler regression model, and we showed how these two indicators could be easily used to monitor the infection in the three clusters. We showed with simulations that these two simpler indicators were a good approximation of these key quantities.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542988","title":"A Bayesian approach to Mendelian randomization using summary statistics in the univariable and multivariable settings with correlated pleiotropy","authors":"Grant, A.

Due to the recent abundance of high-powered genome-wide association studies, many putative causal exposures of interest have large numbers of independent genetic variants with which they associate, each representing a potential instrument for use in a Mendelian randomization analysis. Such polygenic analyses increase the power of the study design to detect causal effects, however they also increase the potential for bias due to instrument invalidity. Recent attention has been given to dealing with bias caused by correlated pleiotropy, which results from violation of the Instrument Strength independent of Direct Effect assumption. Although methods have been proposed which can account for this bias, a number of restrictive conditions remain in many commonly used techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian framework for Mendelian randomization which provides valid causal inference under very general settings. We propose the methods MR-Horse and MVMR-Horse, which can be performed without access to individual-level data, using only summary statistics of the type commonly published by genome-wide association studies, and can account for both correlated and uncorrelated pleiotropy. In simulation studies, we show that the approach retains type I error rates below nominal levels even in high pleiotropy scenarios. We consider an applied example looking at the causal relationship between combinations of four exposures (LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and birth weight) and three outcomes (coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes and asthma).","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.02.543409","title":"A marine cryptochrome with an inverse photo-oligomerization mechanism","authors":"Vu, H.

Although much has been learned about the early phase of reticulocyte maturation in the bone marrow of the adult mammal, after enucleation of the orthochromatic erythroblast, the final maturation of peripheral circulating reticulocytes into RBCs is still poorly understood. Research on reticulocyte maturation was predominantly carried out on stress reticulocytes, or mixed populations of RBCs and normal reticulocytes, strongly limiting the possibility of discriminating different maturational phases and the relative underlying mechanisms. Another limitation was a somewhat \"proteinocentric\" approach, whereby possible qualitative and quantitative changes in the most important structural component of the membrane, the lipids, were not investigated. In the marrow, the reticulocyte matures through processes intrinsic to the cell (autophagy, ubiquitin\/proteasome-dependent proteolysis, exosome release, regulated volume decrease) to reduce its size and simplify its composition. In the circulation, the task is taken over by systemic intervention that is necessary for the removal of extra surface area and to stimulate further volume decrease. The last two processes are preliminary to and go along with the completion of the assembly of the membrane skeleton and its anchoring to the bilayer into a structurally and functionally stable plasma membrane. The selective membrane removal in the marrow phase of maturation leads to the loss of most of the transferrin receptor through release of exosomes enriched in membrane rafts. In the circulatory phase, membrane area decrease is obtained by (a) different mechanism(s), as indicated by several pieces of evidence, including the results of the present study We have isolated here two populations of circulating reticulocytes at different levels of maturation in vivo, and three subpopulations of RBCs of different age from normal human donors, and characterized the evolution of their lipidome. Sphingomyelin, cholesterol and in part phosphatidylethanolamine increase in relative terms, whereas phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine decrease from immature reticulocytes to mature RBCs, at the same time as the surface area per cell decreases. Moreover, the relative amounts of the more than 70 phospholipid subclasses evaluated in the study, based on the number of carbon atoms (12-24) and of double bonds (0-6) in the fatty acids linked to the phospholipid, also change in the process. This complex remodeling suggests the presence of an underlying blueprint, whereby changes in each individual phospholipid subclass all seem to converge in producing a state of higher liquid order, and thus of higher stability, in the lipid bilayer. Results also strongly hint at the lipid remodeling as the driving force, together with cell shrinkage, for the organization of spectrin in an extended meshwork and its anchoring to the bilayer through vertical interactions with intrinsic membrane proteins. A model is proposed, based on concepts of lipid interdigitation and protein \"pinning\".","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.01.543345","title":"AGILE Platform: A Deep Learning-Powered Approach to Accelerate LNP Development for mRNA Delivery","authors":"Xu, Y.; Ma, S.; Cui, H.; Chen, J.; Xu, S.; Wang, K.; Varley, A.; Lu, R.

In this study, we present the AI-Guided Ionizable Lipid Engineering (AGILE) platform, a synergistic combination of deep learning and combinatorial chemistry. AGILE streamlines the iterative development of ionizable lipids, crucial components for LNP-mediated mRNA delivery. This approach brings forth three significant features: efficient design and synthesis of combinatorial lipid libraries, comprehensive in silico lipid screening employing deep neural networks, and adaptability to diverse cell lines. Using AGILE, we were able to rapidly design, synthesize, and evaluate new ionizable lipids for mRNA delivery in muscle and immune cells, selecting from a library of over 10,000 candidates. Importantly, AGILE has revealed cell-specific preferences for ionizable lipids, indicating the need for different tail lengths and head groups for optimal delivery to varying cell types. These results underscore the potential of AGILE in expediting the development of customized LNPs. This could significantly contribute to addressing the complex needs of mRNA delivery in clinical practice, thereby broadening the scope and efficacy of mRNA therapies.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543050","title":"Metagenomic Profiles of Archaea and Bacteria within Thermal and Geochemical Gradients of the Guaymas Basin Deep Subsurface","authors":"Geller-McGrath, D.; Mara, P.; Edgcomb, V.

While it is recognized that manipulating the rhizosphere has the potential to improve plant fitness and health, engineering the rhizosphere microbiome through inoculation has often proved challenging. This is in large part due to the competitive microbial ecosystem in which the added microbes must survive, and lack of adaptation of these added microbes to the specific metabolic and environmental pressures of the rhizosphere. Here, we constructed an inoculation formula using a defined synthetic community (dSynCom) approach that we hypothesized would improve engraftment efficiency and potentially the relationship with the host plant, Sorghum bicolor. The dSynCom was assembled from bacterial isolates that were either: 1) identified to potentially play a role in community cohesion through network analysis, or 2) identified to benefit from host-specific exudate compounds. Growth of the dSynCom was first evaluated in vitro on solid media, secondly in planta under gnotobiotic laboratory conditions, and finally using sorghum plants grown in the field. We demonstrate that the dSynCom performs best in terms of maintaining diversity when grown in the presence of the plant host in lab conditions, and that many lineages are lost from the community when grown either in vitro or in a native field setting. Finally, we demonstrate that the dSynCom is able to promote growth of above- and below-ground plant phenotypes compared to uninoculated controls, both in the lab and when applied to plants grown in the field. These results demonstrate the potential utility of SynComs for supporting crop performance even in the absence of persistence, and the need for a deeper mechanistic understanding of community control of host fitness in agricultural contexts.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.02.543470","title":"Electrophysiological correlates of (mis)judging social information","authors":"Wischnewski, M.; Ho\u0308rberg, M.

To do so, we assessed the individual propensity of being affiliative (i.e., sociality) along with grooming reciprocity at the group level. Our data set included nine years of ad libitium social data on three neighbouring groups of wild vervet monkeys from the Inkawu Vervet Project (IVP), South Africa.

Despite yearly fluctuations in sociality, differences between groups remained stable over time. Moreover, our model predictions confirmed that these findings were maintained for similar sex ratios, age distributions and group sizes. Strikingly, our results suggested that dispersing males adapted their sociality to the sociality of the group they integrated. As a whole, our study sheds new light on the existence of stable social dynamics dependent upon group identity in wild vervet monkeys and suggests that at least part of this variability is socially mediated.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543018","title":"Metabuli: sensitive and specific metagenomic classification via joint analysis of amino-acid and DNA","authors":"Kim, J.; Steinegger, M.","author_corresponding":"Martin Steinegger","author_corresponding_institution":"Seoul National University","date":"2023-06-02","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"bioinformatics","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/02\/2023.05.31.543018.source.xml","abstract":"Current metagenomic classifiers analyze either DNA or amino-acid (AA) sequences.

The interaction of PALB2 with DNA strongly enhances the efficiency of HR. Importantly, the PALB2 DNA-binding domain (PALB2-DBD) supports strand exchange of DNA or RNA, a complex multistep reaction carried by only a few protein families like RecA-like recombinases or Rad52. The mechanisms of PALB2 DNA binding and strand exchange are unknown. Through circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering, we found that the PALB2-DBD is intrinsically disordered, even when bound to DNA. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are prevalent in the human proteome and have many important biological functions. The advanced level of complexity of the strand exchange reaction significantly expands the functional repertoire of IDPs. Using confocal single-molecule FRET, we found that PALB2-DBD binding leads to oligomerization-dependent compaction of DNA. We hypothesize that PALB2-DBD uses a chaperone-like mechanism to aid formation and resolution of complex DNA and RNA multichain intermediates during DNA replication and repair. Similar DNA-binding IDRs may represent a novel class of functional domains evolved in eukaryotic nucleic acids metabolism complexes.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.02.543431","title":"Symmetry in frontal but not motor and somatosensory corticocortical and corticostriatal circuitry","authors":"Papale, A.

While sensory cortical areas had strongly topographic outputs to ipsilateral cortex and striatum, they were weaker and not as topographically strong to contralateral targets.

Here we investigate responses of PV interneurons in different layers of primary somatosensory barrel cortex (BC) to different excitatory inputs. With the genetically-encoded hybrid voltage sensor, hVOS, we recorded voltage changes simultaneously in many L2\/3 and L4 PV interneurons to stimulation in either L2\/3 or L4.

These differences in latency between layers could influence their windows for temporal integration. Thus PV interneurons in different cortical layers of BC show differences in response properties with potential roles in cortical computations.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542986","title":"Uncovering the role that specific genes play in reachability properties of complex biological Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs): The Arabidopsis thaliana flower development case","authors":"Chairez-Veloz, J.

Therefore, a sustained effort to understand the dynamical properties of these modularly structured networks has shown the great utility of experimentally grounded and dynamically characterized discrete Boolean models, as an ideal formalism based on dynamical systems modeling tool for its qualitative description. Up to now, several low-dimensional Boolean GRNs have been proposed to recover gene activation configurations observed for specific cell types, and they have been validated via robustness and mutant analyses. Nevertheless, systematic studies that elucidate the role of individual genes implicated on transitions between given attractors in the context of morphogenetic patterns of development, are still very scarce. Such sort of studies is in fact quite relevant because genes belonging to a given GRN do not work in isolation. Indeed, they could interact with others GRN's and\/or with micro-environmental cues. Consequently, the structural specificities of the involved genes at the network level should be assessed in order to uncover the functional nature of the larger network involved. This is particularly meaningful when considering the role played by specific genes on transient dynamics related to cell fate specification. Following this idea, we propose here a computer-based analytical procedure intended to elucidate the role that specific genes play on the reachability properties of GRNs. As a structural property of a given dynamical network, reachability characterizes the attainability of specified attractors from given initial attractors as a consequence of the action of specific driving exogenous stimuli. Our proposal is based on algebraic systems approaches built around the Semi-Tensor Product (STP). We illustrate here our proposed procedure through the exploration of the reachability properties of the well-known Floral Organ Specification GRN of Arabidopsis thaliana (FOS-GRN), that recovers ten fixed-point attractors. Our findings suggest that there exist 79 inducible transitions among all possible pairs of attractors, with a suitable external Boolean control input over different well-characterized nodes of the network. Additionally, we found that such potentiality of these genes to produce attractor transitions is maintained by the continuous approximation model of the FOS-GRN, recovering not only qualitative but also useful quantitative information. Finally, we discussed the biological significance of our results and, even if we do not establish the specific molecular nature of the characterized exogenous control input, we concluded that reachability analysis can give us some important insights on the network level role that individual genes acquire by their collaboration with the GRN, becoming then targets in cell-fate decisions during development.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.01.543223","title":"Demonstration that sublinear dendrites enable linearly non-separable computations","authors":"Caze, R.

Notably, sublinear dendritic operations enable LNSCs when scattered synaptic activation generates increased somatic spike output. However, experimental demonstrations of scatter-sensitive neuronal computations have not yet been described. Using glutamate uncaging onto cerebellar molecular layer interneurons, we show that scattered synaptic-like activation of dendrites evoked larger compound EPSPs than clustered synaptic activation, generating a higher output spiking probability. Moreover, we also demonstrate that single interneurons can indeed implement the FBP. Since sublinear synaptic summation is a property of passive dendrites we expect that many different neuron types can implement LNSCs.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542992","title":"Coherent feedback leads to robust background compensation in oscillatory and non-oscillatory homeostats","authors":"Nygard, M.; Ruoff, P.","author_corresponding":"Peter Ruoff","author_corresponding_institution":"University of Stavanger: Universitetet i Stavanger","date":"2023-06-02","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"systems biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/02\/2023.05.30.542992.source.xml","abstract":"When in an integral feedback controller a step perturbation is applied at a constant background, the controlled variable (described here as A) will in general respond with decreased response amplitudes {Delta} A as backgrounds increase. The controller variable E will at the same time provide the necessary compensatory flux to move A back to its set-point. A typical example of decreased response amplitudes at increased backgrounds is found in retinal light adaptation. Due to remarks in the literature that retinal light adaptation would also involve a compensation of backgrounds we became interested in conditions how background compensation could occur. In this paper we describe how background influences can be robustly eliminated. When such a background compensation is active, oscillatory controllers will respond to a defined perturbation with always the same (damped or undamped) frequency profile, or in the non-oscillatory case, with the same response amplitude {Delta} A, irrespective of the background level. To achieve background compensation we found that two conditions need to apply: (i) an additional set of integral controllers (here described as I_1 and I_2) have to be employed to keep the manipulated variable E at a defined set-point, and (ii), I_1 and I_2 need to feed back to the A-E signaling axis directly through the controlled variable A. In analogy to a similar feedback applied in quantum control theory, we term these feedback conditions as 'coherent feedback'. When analyzing retinal light adaptations in more detail, we find no evidence in the presence of background compensation mechanisms. Although robust background compensation, as described theoretically here, appears to be an interesting regulatory property, relevant biological or biochemical examples still need to be identified.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.02.543370","title":"Morphological brain networks of white matter: mapping, evaluation, characterization and application","authors":"Li, J.; Li, Z.; Yang, Y.; Luo, Z.; Liu, Y.; Wang, J.","author_corresponding":"Jinhui Wang","author_corresponding_institution":"South China Normal University","date":"2023-06-02","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/02\/2023.06.02.543370.source.xml","abstract":"Neuroimaging-based connectomics studies have long focused on the wiring patterns between gray matter regions. In recent years, increasing evidence emerges that neural activity in specific sets of white matter (WM) tracts dynamically fluctuates in a coordinated manner. However, the structural basis underlying the coordination is poorly understood largely due to the lack of approaches for estimating structural relations between WM regions. Here, we developed an approach to construct morphological WM networks based on structural magnetic resonance imaging. We found that the morphological WM networks exhibited nontrivial organizational principles, presented good to excellent short- and long-term reliability, accounted for phenotypic interindividual differences (Motor and Cognition), and were under genetic control. Interestingly, highly heritable edges contributed largely to interindividual differences in phenotype. Through integration with other multimodal and multiscale data, we further showed that the morphological WM networks were able to predict regional profiles of hamodynamic coherence, metabolic synchronization, gene co-expression and chemoarchitectonic covariance. Moreover, the prediction followed functional connectomic hierarchy of WM for hamodynamic coherence, was driven by genes enriched in the forebrain neuron development and differentiation for gene co-expression, and was attributed to serotonergic system-related receptors and transporters for chemoarchitectonic covariance. Finally, applying our approach to multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, we found that both diseases were associated with morphological WM dysconnectivity, which was correlated with clinical variables and able to diagnose and differentiate the diseases. Altogether, our findings indicate that morphological WM networks provide a reliable and meaningful means to explore WM architecture in health and disease.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.02.543490","title":"Dendritic voltage imaging reveals biophysical basis of associative plasticity rules","authors":"Park, P.; Wong-Campos, J.

We mapped sub-millisecond voltage dynamics throughout the dendritic trees of CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute brain slices. Our data show history-dependent bAP propagation in distal dendrites, driven by locally generated Na+ spikes (dSpikes).

However, the selection of an optimal window length is non-trivial, and depends on the properties of the connectivity metric being used as well as the effects of interest within the data (e.g. developmental or inter-brain effects). A systematic investigation of these factors, and objective criteria for window size selection are currently missing in the literature, particularly in regard to pediatric datasets. Here, we provide a principled examination of the effect of window size on optimization of signal to noise ratio for linear and non-linear EEG connectivity, as applied to infant, adult and dyadic (infant-adult) datasets. We employed a linear weighted phase lag index (wPLI), and a nonlinear weighted symbolic mutual information (wSMI) metric to assess brain connectivity for each dataset. Our results showed a clear polar dissociation between linear and non-linear metrics, as well as between infant and adult datasets in optimal window size. Further, optimal dyadic (infant-adult) window size settings defaulted to one or the partner rather than reflecting an intermediate compromise. Given the specificity of these results (i.e. there was no single window size that was optimal for all contrasts), we conclude that a formal analysis of optimal window size may be useful prior to conducting any new connectivity analysis. Here, we recommend guiding principles, performance metrics and decision criteria for optimal and unbiased window size selection.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.02.543379","title":"Defining Vaginal Community Dynamics: daily microbiome transitions, the role of menstruation, bacteriophages and bacterial genes","authors":"Hugerth, L.

What defines these dynamics, and whether these differences are microbiome-intrinsic or mostly driven by the host is unknown. To address this, we characterized 49 healthy, young women by metagenomic sequencing of daily vaginal swabs during a menstrual cycle. We classified the dynamics of the vaginal microbiome and assessed the impact of host behavior as well as microbiome differences at the species, strain, gene and phage levels. Results: Based on the daily shifts in community state types (CSTs) during a menstrual cycle the vaginal microbiome was classified into four Vaginal Community Dynamics (VCDs) and reported in a classification tool, named VALODY: constant eubiotic, constant dysbiotic, menses-related and unstable dysbiotic. The abundance of bacteria, phages, and bacterial gene content was compared between the four VCDs. Women with different VCDs showed significant differences in relative phage abundance and bacterial composition even when assigned to the same CST. Women with unstable VCDs had higher phage counts and were more likely dominated by L. iners. Their Gardnerella spp. strains were also more likely to harbour bacteriocin-coding genes. Conclusions: The VCDs present a novel time series classification which highlights the complexity of varying degrees of vaginal dysbiosis. Knowing the differences in phage levels and the genomic strains present allows a deeper understanding of the initiation and maintenance of permanent dysbiosis. Applying the VCDs to further characterize the different types of microbiome dynamics qualifies the investigation of disease and enables comparisons at individual and population levels. Based on our data, to be able to classify a dysbiotic sample into the accurate VCD, clinicians would need two-three mid-cyclical samples and two samples during menses. In the future, it will be important to address whether transient VCDs pose a similar risk profile to persistent dysbiosis with similar clinical outcomes. This framework may aid interdisciplinary translational teams in deciphering the role of the vaginal microbiome in womens health and reproduction.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.02.543389","title":"Iron chelation by deferoxamine as useful adjunct therapeutics in murine tuberculosis.","authors":"Kaushik, S.

The current study aimed to identify the specific cells expressing THBS2\/TSP2 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and investigate the underlying mechanism behind THBS2\/TSP2 up-regulation. Comprehensive NAFLD liver gene datasets, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), in-house NAFLD liver tissue, and LX-2 cells derived from human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), were analyzed using a combination of computational biology, genetic, immunological, and pharmacological approaches. Analysis of the genetic dataset revealed the presence of 1433 variable genes in patients with advanced fibrosis NAFLD, with THBS2 ranked among the top 2 genes. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction examination of NAFLD livers showed a significant correlation between THBS2 expression and fibrosis stage (r=0.349, p<0.001). In support of this, scRNA-seq data and in situ hybridization demonstrated that the THBS2 gene was highly expressed in HSCs of NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis. Pathway analysis of the gene dataset revealed THBS2 expression to be associated with the transforming growth factor beta (TGF{beta}) pathway and collagen gene activation. Moreover, the activation of LX-2 cells with TGF{beta} increased THBS2\/TSP2 and collagen expression independently of the TGF{beta}-SMAD2\/3 pathway. THBS2 gene knockdown significantly decreased collagen expression in LX-2 cells. In conclusion, THBS2\/TSP2 is highly expressed in HSCs and plays a role in regulating fibrogenesis in NAFLD patients. THBS2\/TSP2 may therefore represent a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapy in NAFLD.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.06.01.543292","title":"Assessing the performance of commercial reagent antibodies","authors":"Ayoubi, R.; Ryan, J.; Fotouhi, M.; Alshafie, W.; Bolivar, S.

The biomedical research community aspires to have at least one potent and selective renewable antibody for each human protein, and for each of the common applications. To quantify the potential to achieve this goal with commercial reagent antibodies, we applied a standardized characterization approach to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins in Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence applications, using isogenic knockout cells as controls. By carrying out side-by-side comparisons of the antibodies, we demonstrate that: i) for each application tested, 61% to 89% of this protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody with 54% to 77% covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant; ii) on average recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies; iii) hundreds of underperforming antibodies have been used in published articles. Encouragingly, of the commercial antibodies that did not perform as expected, 18% were removed from the market by manufacturers and 37% had alterations made to their recommended usage.

The presence of genetically distinct pathogenic variants within an infection, referred to as multiplicity of infection (MOI) or complexity of infection (COI) is common in malaria and similar infectious diseases. It is an important metric that scales with transmission intensities, potentially affects the clinical pathogenesis, and a confounding factor when monitoring the frequency and prevalence of pathogenic variants. Several statistical methods exist to estimate MOI and the frequency distribution of pathogen variants. However, a common problem is the quality of the underlying molecular data. If molecular assays fail not randomly, it is likely to underestimate MOI and the prevalence of pathogen variants. Methods and findings: A statistical model is introduced which explicitly addresses data quality, by assuming a probability by which a pathogen variant remains undetected in a molecular assay. This is different from the assumption of missing at random, for which a molecular assay either performs perfectly or fails completely. The method is applicable to a single molecular marker and allows to estimate allele-frequency spectra, the distribution of MOI, and the probability of variants to remain undetected (incomplete information).Based on the statistical model, expressions for the prevalence of pathogen variants are derived and differences between frequency and prevalence are discussed. The usual desirable asymptotic properties of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) are established by rewriting the model into an exponential family. The MLE has promising finite sample properties in terms of bias and variance. The covariance matrix of the estimator is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (inverse Fisher information). Importantly, the estimators variance is larger than that of a similar method which disregards incomplete information, but its bias is smaller. Conclusions: Although the model introduced here has convenient properties, in terms of the mean squared error it does not outperform a simple standard method that neglects missing information. Thus, the new method is recommendable only for data sets in which the molecular assays produced poor quality results. This will be particularly true if the model is extended to accommodate information from multiple molecular markers at the same time, and incomplete information at one or more markers leads to strong depletion of sample size.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543180","title":"Interactions Between the Histone Variant H2Av and the Suppressor of Hairy wing Insulator Influence the DNA Damage Response and Lymph Gland Development in Drosophila","authors":"Simmons, J.

Indeed, mutations of the sole insulator protein in humans, CTCF, are carcinogenic and mutations in the Drosophila insulator protein Suppressor of Hairy wing [Su(Hw)] lead to chromosomal rearrangements. However, the mechanism that links the DNA damage response and the regulation of transcription with insulator function is not yet understood. Here we show that enrichment of Su(Hw) insulator proteins at insulator sites increases after DNA damage. Additionally, Su(Hw) is necessary for phosphorylation of the histone variant H2Av in response to both UV treatment and X-ray irradiation. The requirement of Su(Hw) for H2Av phosphorylation appears to be tissue-specific, since H2Av is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage also in neurons, where Su(Hw) is not normally expressed. Similarly, we provide evidence that Su(Hw) and H2Av work together to ensure proper development of the lymph gland in Drosophila larvae. We show that H2Av regulates formation of the larval lymph gland, and mutation of H2Av causes formation of large melanotic tumors that are rescued by mutation of su(Hw) in the His2Av810 mutant background. Double mutants of su(Hw)- and His2Av810 also form supernumerary lymph gland lobes that are larger than in wild type. Our findings support a role for the Su(Hw) in the DNA damage response through the regulation of H2Av phosphorylation and suggest that Su(Hw) and H2Av also work together to ensure proper development of the lymph gland.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543034","title":"Audiotactile stimulation can improve syllable discrimination through multisensory integration in the theta frequency band","authors":"Guilleminot, P.

We recently showed that tactile stimuli linked to the perceptual centers of syllables in continuous speech can improve speech comprehension. The rate of syllables lies in the theta frequency range, between 4 and 8 Hz, and the behavioural effect appears linked to multisensory integration in this frequency band. Because this neural activity may be oscillatory, we hypothesized that a behavioural effect may also occur not only while but also after this activity has been evoked or entrained through vibrotactile pulses. Here we show that audiotactile integration regarding the perception of single syllables, both on the neural and on the behavioural level, is consistent with this hypothesis. We first stimulated subjects with a series of vibrotactile pulses and then presented them with a syllable in background noise. We show that, at a delay of 200 ms after the last vibrotactile pulse, audiotactile integration still occurred in the theta band and syllable discrimination was enhanced. Moreover, the dependence of both the neural multisensory integration as well as of the behavioral discrimination on the delay of the audio signal with respect to the last tactile pulse was consistent with a damped oscillation. In addition, the multisensory gain is correlated with the syllable discrimination score. Our results therefore evidence the role of the theta band in audiotactile integration and provide evidence that these effect may involve oscillatory activity that still persists after the tactile stimulation.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543028","title":"Leveraging information between multiple population groups and traits improves fine-mapping resolution","authors":"Zhou, F.; Soremekun, O.; Chikowore, T.; Fatumo, S.; Barroso, I.; Morris, A.; Asimit, J.

Here, we developed an arrayed screen of 14 morphogen modulators in human neural organoids cultured for over 70 days.

Mammals are unusual in primarily displaying male-biased SSD, where males of a species are typically larger than females. The driving factors behind the evolution of this SSD have been much debated, with popular hypotheses including the influence of mating system and social organisation via sexual selection, dietary niche divergence, and the role of body size (Renschs rule). Here, we investigate the macroevolutionary origins and maintenance of SSD among mammals, using phylogenetic general mixed linear models and a comprehensive global dataset to evaluate correlations of diet, body mass, seasonality, social organisation, and mating system with SSD type. We find that SSD as a whole is lost at a greater rate than it is gained, with female-biased SSD being particularly unstable. Non-monogamy, vertebrate prey consumption, and temperature seasonality correlate with male-biased SSD, while polyandry correlates with female-biased SSD, and both types of SSD are positively correlated with body mass. This is in partial contrast to the predictions of Renschs rule, which predicts that female-biased SSD would correlate negatively with body size. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple ecological and social drivers when evaluating the macroevolutionary trajectory of sex differences in body size.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543025","title":"Phase-locking of neural activity to the envelope of speech in the delta frequency band reflects differences between word lists and sentences","authors":"Mohammadi, Y.; Graversen, C.; Ostergaard, J.; Kaeseler Andersen, O.; Reichenbach, T.","author_corresponding":"Tobias Reichenbach","author_corresponding_institution":"Friedrich-Alexander-University (FAU) Erlangen-Nuremberg","date":"2023-06-01","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/01\/2023.05.31.543025.source.xml","abstract":"The envelope of a speech signal is tracked by neural activity in the cerebral cortex.

However, much regarding the more specific association between cortical tracking and acoustic as well as linguistic processing remains to be uncovered. Here we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to both meaningful sentences as well as random word lists in different levels of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that lead to different levels of speech comprehension as well as listening effort.

In this study, we describe a series of experiments conducted with an individual with neglect, DH. DH presents characteristic lack of awareness of the left side of individual objects, evidenced by poor object and face recognition, and impaired word reading. However, he exhibits intact recognition of color within the boundaries of the same objects he fails to recognize.

To our knowledge, selective lack of awareness of shape despite intact processing of basic visual features in the same spatial location has not been reported previously. DH's performance raises intriguing questions and challenges about the role of spatial attention in the formation of coherent object percepts and visual awareness.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.539801","title":"Single cell-guided prenatal derivation of primary epithelial organoids from the human amniotic and tracheal fluids.","authors":"Gerli, M.

New patient-specific prenatal disease modelling may optimise personalised prediction. We and others have described the presence of mesenchymal stem cells in amniotic fluid (AFSC) that can generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The lengthy reprogramming processes, however, limits the ability to define individual phenotypes or plan prenatal treatment. Therefore, it would be advantageous if fetal stem cells could be obtained during pregnancy and expanded without reprogramming. Using single cell analysis, we characterised the cellular identities in amniotic fluid (AF) and identified viable epithelial stem\/progenitor cells of fetal intestinal, renal and pulmonary origin. With relevance for prenatal disease modelling, these cells could be cultured to form clonal epithelial organoids manifesting small intestine, kidney and lung identity. To confirm this, we derived lung organoids from AF and tracheal fluid (TF) cells of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) fetuses and found that they show differences to non-CDH controls and can recapitulate some pathological features of the disease. Amniotic Fluid Organoids (AFO) allow investigation of fetal epithelial tissues at clinically relevant developmental stages and may enable the development of therapeutic tools tailored to the fetus, as well as to predicting the effects of such therapies.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.542302","title":"Profiling sorghum-microbe interactions with a specialized photoaffinity probe identifies key sorgoleone binders in Acinetobacter pittii","authors":"Kroll, J.

To promote more robust and sustainable growth of this important crop, we need a deeper understanding of the plant-microbe interactions between sorghum and soil microbial communities that benefit plant host resiliency and enhance nutrient acquisition. The release of specific metabolites from plant roots, or root exudation, drives these plant-microbe interactions, but the molecular pathways by which root exudates shape the sorghum rhizosphere microbiome require further elucidation. To investigate these complex interkingdom interactions in the sorghum rhizosphere, we developed a photoaffinity probe based on sorgoleone, a hydrophobic secondary metabolite and allelochemical produced in sorghum seedling root exudates. Here, we apply a new synthetic sorgoleone diazirine alkyne photoaffinity probe (SoDA-PAL) to the identification of sorgoleone-binding proteins in Acinetobacter pittii SO1, a potential plant growth promoting microbe derived from Sorghum bicolor rhizosphere soil. Competitive photoaffinity labeling of A. pittii whole cell lysates with SoDA-PAL identified 137 statistically enriched proteins that were complementary to a previously identified gene cluster involved in sorgoleone catabolism. Proteins identified by SoDA-PAL included a select set of putative transporters, transcription regulators, and a subset of proteins with lipid and secondary metabolic activities. We confirm binding of SoDA-PAL to a putative hydrolase in the \/{beta} fold family (OH685_09420) through structural bioinformatics and in-vitro recombinant protein analysis. This photoaffinity labeling approach using metabolite-based probes can be extended in the future to proteomic profiling of complex rhizosphere microbiomes to discover genes that can be leveraged to promote beneficial plant-microbe interactions.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.29.542760","title":"Boosting Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis with Simple Neural Attention","authors":"Davalos, O.

Recently, engineered recruitment of methyltransferases (DNMTs) at specific loci was shown to be sufficient to silence synthetic and endogenous gene expression through this mechanism. A critical parameter for DNA methylation-based silencing is the distribution of CpGs within the target promoter. However, how the number or density of CpGs in the target promoter affects the dynamics of silencing by DNMT recruitment has remained unclear. Here we constructed a library of promoters with systematically varying CpG content, and analyzed the rate of silencing in response to recruitment of DNMT. We observed a tight correlation between silencing rate and CpG content. Further, methylation-specific analysis revealed a constant accumulation rate of methylation at the promoter after DNMT recruitment. We identified a single CpG site between TATA box and transcription start site (TSS) that accounted for a substantial part of the difference in silencing rates between promoters with differing CpG content, indicating that certain residues play disproportionate roles in controlling silencing. Together, these results provide a library of promoters for synthetic epigenetic and gene regulation applications, as well as insights into the regulatory link between CpG content and silencing rate.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.542532","title":"Distinct neural representations during a brain-machine interface and manual reaching task in motor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and striatum","authors":"Zippi, E.

Thus, the standard hypothesis is that high-level functions like object categorization are primarily mediated by higher visual areas because they require more complex image formats that are not evident in early visual processing stages. However, human observers can categorize images as objects or animals or as big or small even when the images preserve only some low and mid-level features but are rendered unidentifiable (\"texforms\", Long et al., 2018). This observation suggests that even the early visual cortex, in which neurons respond to simple stimulus features, may already encode signals about these more abstract high-level categorical distinctions. We tested this hypothesis by recording from populations of neurons in early and mid-level visual cortical areas while rhesus monkeys viewed texforms and their unaltered source stimuli (simultaneous recordings from areas V1 and V4 in one animal and separate recordings from V1 and V4 in two others). Using recordings from a few dozen neurons, we could decode the real-world size and animacy of both unaltered images and texforms. Furthermore, this neural decoding accuracy across stimuli was related to the ability of human observers to categorize texforms by real-world size and animacy. Our results demonstrate that neuronal populations early in the visual hierarchy contain signals useful for higher-level object perception and suggest that the responses of early visual areas to simple stimulus features display preliminary untangling of higher-level distinctions.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543017","title":"ACTIVATION OF CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 5 BROADENS ACTION POTENTIALS IN HUMAN SENSORY NEURONS","authors":"Tiwari, M.

Tissue or nerve injuries induce comprehensive neurobiological plasticity in nociceptive neurons, which leads to chronic pain. Recent studies suggest that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in primary afferents is a key neuronal kinase that modulates nociception through phosphorylation-dependent manner under pathological conditions. However, the impact of the CDK5 on nociceptor activity especially in human sensory neurons are not known. To determine the CDK5-mediated regulation of human dorsal root ganglia (hDRG) neuronal properties, we have performed the whole-cell patch clamp recordings in neurons dissociated from hDRG. CDK5 activation induced by overexpression of p35 depolarized the resting membrane potential and reduced the rheobase currents as compared to the uninfected neurons. CDK5 activation evidently changed the shape of the action potential (AP) by increasing AP rise time, AP fall time, and AP half width. The application of a prostaglandin E2 (PG) and bradykinin (BK) cocktail in uninfected hDRG neurons induced the depolarization of RMP and the reduction of rheobase currents along with increased AP rise time. However, PG and BK applications failed to induce any further significant changes in addition to the aforementioned changes of the membrane properties and AP parameters in the p35-overexpressing group. We conclude that CDK5 activation through the overexpression of p35 in dissociated hDRG neurons broadens AP in hDRG neurons and that CDK5 may play important roles in the modulation of AP properties in human primary afferents under pathological conditions, contributing to chronic pain.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543129","title":"CD4+ T-cell immunity of SARS-CoV-2 patients determine pneumonia development","authors":"Naito, E.; Uchida, T.; Yamasaki, S.; Hashimoto, K.; Miura, Y.; Shiono, A.; Kawamura, T.; Mouri, A.; Yamaguchi, O.; Imai, H.; Kaira, K.; Nemoto, M.; Mitsutake, K.; Nagata, M.; Kagamu, H.","author_corresponding":"Hiroshi Kagamu","author_corresponding_institution":"Saitama Ika Daigaku Kokusai Iryo Center","date":"2023-06-01","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"immunology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/01\/2023.05.31.543129.source.xml","abstract":"Most humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 will recover without developing pneumonia. A few SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, however, develop pneumonia, and occasionally develop cytokine storms. In such cases, it is assumed that there is an inadequate immune response to eliminate viral infected cells and an excessive inappropriate immune response causing organ damage, but little is known about this mechanism. In this study, we used single cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry to analyze peripheral blood T cells from patients hospitalized with proven COVID-19 infection in order to clarify the differences in host immune status among COVID-19 pneumonia cases, non-pneumonia cases, and healthy controls. The results showed that a specific CD4+ T cell cluster with chemokine receptor expression patterns, CXCR3+CCR4-CCR6+ (Th1\/17), was less abundant in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Interestingly, these CD4+ T-cell clusters were identical to those we have reported to correlate with antitumor immunity and predict programmed cell death (PD)-1 blockade treatment response in lung cancer. The Th1\/17 cell percentages had biomarker performance in diagnosing pneumonia cases. In addition, CTLA-4 expression of type17 helper T cells (Th17) and regulatory T cells (Treg) was found to be significantly lower. This indicates that functional suppression of Th17 was less effective and Treg function was impaired in pneumonia cases. These results suggest that imbalance of CD4+ T-cell immunity generates excessive immunity that does not lead to viral eradication. This might be a potential therapeutic target mechanism to prevent severe viral infections.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542314","title":"A semi-quantitative, rapid, point of care SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay predicts neutralizing antibody levels","authors":"Markmann, A.

In the current time of vaccine availability and new therapeutic development, including antibody-based therapies, many questions about long-term immunity and protection remain uncertain. Identification of protective antibodies in individuals is often done using highly specialized and challenging assays such as functional neutralizing assays, which are not available in the clinical setting. Therefore, there is a great need for the development of rapid, clinically available assays that correlate with neutralizing antibody assays to identify individuals who may benefit from additional vaccination or specific COVID-19 therapies. In this report, we apply a novel semi-quantitative method to an established lateral flow assay (sqLFA) and analyze its ability to detect the presence functional neutralizing antibodies from the serum of COVID-19 recovered individuals. We found that the sqLFA has a strong positive correlation with neutralizing antibody levels. At lower assay cutoffs, the sqLFA is a highly sensitive assay to identify the presence of a range of neutralizing antibody levels. At higher cutoffs, it can detect higher levels of neutralizing antibody with high specificity. This sqLFA can be used both as a screening tool to identify individuals with any level of neutralizing antibody to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or as a more specific tool to identify those with high neutralizing antibody levels who may not benefit from antibody-based therapies or further vaccination.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.540128","title":"Distance sampling with vehicle-mounted cameras for the estimation of farmland bird abundance over a wide area.","authors":"Kumada, N.; Fukasawa, K.; Yoshioka, A.; Tsuda, N.; Ouchi, H.","author_corresponding":"Nao Kumada","author_corresponding_institution":"Biodiversity Division, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","date":"2023-06-01","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_no","category":"ecology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/01\/2023.05.31.540128.source.xml","abstract":"Agricultural birds are declining due to farmland abandonment and agricultural intensification, and monitoring approaches, including efficient survey methods, are crucial for the development of effective conservation strategies. Roadside surveys (RS), especially those using vehicle-mounted video cameras, can be used to efficiently search for targets; however, they are limited by the unknown detection range. Distance sampling (DS), in which animal density or abundance is estimated from the distance between the observer and the detected individual, can provide a complimentary approach to address this limitation of RS. We developed a DS model robust to location uncertainty based on video-based RS. We integrated location errors determined by an independent field test using RS and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into a stochastic DS model. We estimated the abundance of herons and egrets in farmlands in and around the evacuation zone of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident by combining RS and DS. The video-based RS covered 7,031 km of roads and 24.41 km2 of farmlands. All herons and egrets were observed around the evacuation zone and none were detected in the zone. The predicted abundance of herons and egrets differed substantially between areas inside (0.0158 {+\/-} 0.0174\/km2) and outside of the zone (4.62 {+\/-} 5.41\/km2). Integrating location uncertainty into the DS model did not affect predicted heron and egret population densities (4.62 {+\/-} 5.41 vs. 4.66 {+\/-} 5.45\/km2, with or without integrating location uncertainty, respectively). Accordingly, our survey method combining RS and DS is robust to location uncertainty. The study system (i.e., herons and egrets in farmlands) and the inability of location error to exceed the size of one farmland separated by levees may contribute to the accuracy of RS in this study. Synthesis and Applications: Combining RS with vehicle-mounted cameras and DS considering location uncertainty is widely applicable to open land species and can improve the efficiency of monitoring. When large location errors are expected by conventional approaches, DS models incorporating location uncertainty determined by RS and UAVs could be effective for abundance estimation over wide areas.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.542109","title":"A comprehensive evolutionary scenario for the origin and neofunctionalization of the Drosophila speciation gene Odysseus (OdsH)","authors":"Vilas Boas Nunes, W.; Siqueira de Oliveira, D.; de Rezende Dias, G.; Carvalho, A.

This gene was first described in the melanogaster subgroup and more specifically in the sterile hybrids from crosses between D. mauritiana and D. simulans. Its origin is attributed to the duplication of the gene unc-4, which would have occurred in the ancestor of the subgenus Sophophora. By using a much larger sample of Drosophila species, we showed that contrary to what has been previously proposed, OdsH origin occurred approximately 62 million years ago (Mya). Then, OdsH have experienced rapid neofunctionalization in male reproductive tracts, evidenced by its evolutionary rates, expression and transcription factor binding sites. Furthermore, the analysis of the OdsH peptide sequence allowed the identification of mutations in the DNA- and protein-binding domains of D. mauritiana that could result in incompatibility with genomes from other species. We then explored the expression of OdsH in the spermatocytes of D. arizonae and D. mojavensis, a pair of recently diverged sister species with incomplete reproductive isolation and expected to find the involvement of OdsH in hybrid sterility. Our data indicated that OdsH expression is not atypical in male-sterile hybrids from these species. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the origin of OdsH occurred earlier than previously proposed and that its neofunctionalization in male sexual functions occurred rapidly after its origin. Our results also suggested that its role as a speciation gene, as in the melanogaster subgroup of species, may be restricted to this specific taxon.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.29.542702","title":"Bridging the gap between movement data and connectivity analysis using the time-explicit Step Selection Function (tSSF)","authors":"Valle, D.; Attias, N.; Cullen, J.; Hooten, M.; Giroux, A.; Santos, L.; Desbiez, A.; Fletcher, R.","author_corresponding":"Denis Valle","author_corresponding_institution":"University of Florida","date":"2023-06-01","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"animal behavior and cognition","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/01\/2023.05.29.542702.source.xml","abstract":"Background Understanding how to connect habitat remnants to facilitate the movement of species is a critical task in an increasingly fragmented world impacted by human activities. The identification of dispersal routes and corridors through connectivity analysis requires measures of landscape resistance but there has been no consensus on how to calculate resistance from habitat characteristics, potentially leading to very different connectivity outcomes. Methods We propose a new model called the time-explicit step selection function (tSSF) that can be directly used for connectivity analysis in the context of the spatial absorbing Markov chain (SAMC) framework without requiring arbitrary transformations. The tSSF model combines a time model with a standard selection function and can provide complementary information regarding how animals use landscapes by separately assessing the drivers of time to traverse the landscape and the drivers of habitat selection. These models are illustrated using GPS-tracking data from giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil. Results The time model revealed that the fastest movements tended to occur between 8 pm and 5 am, suggesting a crepuscular\/nocturnal behavior. Giant anteaters moved faster over wetlands while moving much slower over forests and savannas, in comparison to grasslands. We found that wetlands were consistently avoided whereas forest and savannas tended to be selected. Importantly, this model revealed that selection for forest increased with temperature, suggesting that forests may act as important thermal shelters when temperatures are high. Finally, the tSSF results can be used to simulate movement and connectivity within a fragmented landscape, revealing that giant anteaters will often not use the shortest-distance path to the destination patch (because that would require traversing a wetland, an avoided habitat) and that approximately 90% of the individuals will have reached the destination patch after 49 days. Conclusions The approach proposed here can be used to gain a better understanding of how landscape features are perceived by individuals through the decomposition of movement patterns into a time and a habitat selection component. This approach can also help bridge the gap between movement-based models and connectivity analysis, enabling the generation of time-explicit results.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.542682","title":"genomicBERT and data-free deep-learning model evaluation","authors":"Chen, T.; Tyagi, N.; Chauhan, S.; Peleg, A.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown promise in treating recurrent\/metastatic cases, with durable benefit in ~30% of patients. Current biomarkers for head and neck tumors are limited in their dynamic ability to capture tumor microenvironment (TME) features, with an increasing need for deeper tissue characterization. Therefore, new biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients and predict responses to therapy. Here, we have optimized and applied an ultra-high plex, single-cell spatial protein analysis in HNSCC. Tissues were simultaneously analyzed with a panel of 101 antibodies that targeted biomarkers related to tumor immune, metabolic and stress microenvironments. Our data uncovered a high degree of intra-tumoral heterogeneity intrinsic to head and neck tumors and provided unique insights into the biology of the tumor. In particular, a cellular neighborhood analysis revealed the presence of 6 unique spatial tumor-immune neighborhoods enriched in functionally specialized immune cell subsets across the patient tissue. Additionally, functional phenotyping based on key metabolic and stress markers identified four distinct tumor regions with differential protein signatures. One tumor region was marked by infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and overexpression of BAK, a proapoptotic regulator, suggesting strong immune activation and stress. Another adjacent region within the same tumor had high expression of G6PD and MMP9, known drivers of tumor resistance and invasion respectively. This dichotomy of immune activation-induced death and tumor progression in the same sample demonstrates the heterogenous niches and competing microenvironments that underpin clinical responses of therapeutic resistance. Our data integrate single-cell ultra-high plex spatial information with the functional state of the tumor microenvironment to provide insights into a partial response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in HNSCC. We believe that the approach outlined in this study will pave the way towards a new understanding of TME features associated with response and sensitivity to ICI therapies.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542921","title":"Role of XerCD in release of over-replicated DNA through Outer Membrane Vesicles in Escherichia coli","authors":"Mansky, J.; Wang, H.; Wagner-Do\u0308bler, I.; Tomasch, J.","author_corresponding":"J\u00fcrgen Tomasch","author_corresponding_institution":"Institute of Microbiology, CAS Centre Algatech","date":"2023-06-01","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"microbiology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/01\/2023.05.30.542921.source.xml","abstract":"Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are universally produced by prokaryotes and play important roles in symbiotic and pathogenic interactions. Here we show that the Gammaproteobacterium Escherichia coli produces OMVs that contain DNA enriched for the region around the terminus of replication ter, and specifically for the recognition sequence dif of the two site-specific recombinases XerCD, similar to OMVs from the Alphaproteobacterium Dinoroseobacter shibae. In deletion mutants of xerC or xerD, the enriched region around ter becomes broader while the peak directly at the dif sequence itself is reduced.\n\nImportanceImprecise termination of replication can lead to over-replicated parts of bacterial chromosomes that have to be excised and removed from the dividing cell.

One of the strategies the parasite uses to accomplish this is via the export of effector proteins from the secretory dense granules. Dense granule (GRA) proteins are known to play roles in nutrient acquisition, host cell cycle manipulation, and immune regulation. Here, we characterize a novel dense granule protein named GRA83, which localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole in tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Disruption of GRA83 results in increased virulence, weight loss, and parasitemia during the acute infection, as well as a marked increase in the cyst burden during the chronic infection. This increased parasitemia was associated with an accumulation of inflammatory infiltrates in tissues in both the acute and chronic infection. Murine macrophages infected with {Delta}gra83 tachyzoites produced less interleukin-12 (IL-12) in vitro, which was confirmed with reduced IL-12 and interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) in vivo. This dysregulation of cytokines correlates with reduced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of the NF-{kappa}B complex. While GRA15 similarly regulates NF-{kappa}B, infection with {Delta}gra83\/{Delta}gra15 parasites did not further reduce p65 translocation to the host cell nucleus, suggesting these GRAs function in converging pathways. We also used proximity labelling experiments to reveal candidate GRA83 interacting T. gondii derived partners. Taken together, this work reveals a novel effector that stimulates the innate immune response, enabling the host to limit parasite burden.\n\nImportanceToxoplasma gondii poses a significant public health concern as it is recognized as one of the leading foodborne pathogens in the United States. Infection with the parasite can cause congenital defects in neonates, life-threatening complications in immunosuppressed patients, and ocular disease. Specialized secretory organelles, including the dense granules, play an important role in the parasites ability to efficiently invade and regulate components of the hosts infection response machinery to limit parasite clearance and establish an acute infection. Toxoplasmas ability to avoid early clearance, while also successfully infecting the host long enough to establish a persistent chronic infection, is crucial in allowing for its transmission to a new host. While multiple GRAs directly modulate host signaling pathways, they do so in various ways highlighting the parasites diverse arsenal of effectors that govern infection. Understanding how parasite-derived effectors harness host functions to evade defenses yet ensure a robust infection are important for understanding the complexity of the pathogens tightly regulated infection. In this study, we characterize a novel secreted protein named GRA83 that stimulates the host cells response to limit infection.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.29.542733","title":"Emergence of Darwinian evolution in Bayesian collectives","authors":"Csillag, M.; Giaffar, H.; Szathmary, E.; Czegel, D.","author_corresponding":"D\u00e1niel Cz\u00e9gel","author_corresponding_institution":"Institute of Evolution, Centre for Ecological Research, Hungary","date":"2023-06-01","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"evolutionary biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/01\/2023.05.29.542733.source.xml","abstract":"The emergence of self-replication in chemical space has led to an explosive diversification of form and function. It is hypothesized that a similar process underlies human action selection in complex combinatorial spaces, such as the space of simulated action sequences. Furthermore, the spontaneous appearance of a non-predesigned evolutionary search in artificial agents might lead to a higher degree of open-endedness, arguably a key missing component of current machine intelligence. In this paper we design a computational model to show that Darwinian evolutionary dynamics over informational units can emerge if collectives of such units need to infer statistics of changing environments. We build our argument on a series of equivalences between Bayesian computations and replicator dynamics to demonstrate that the selective advantage of higher information transmission ability between units and of larger population size appear very early on, already at no consistently shared information between the population size of two units. Further selection for statistical inference at the collective level leads to a continuous increase of transmission fidelity and population size until the population reaches the ability to maintain and iteratively improve combinatorial information, a transition to the regime of Darwinian evolution. Candidate systems include prebiotic collectives of non-replicating molecules, collectives of neural ensembles representing competing action plans, and reinforcement learning agents with parallel policy search.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542938","title":"Yeast Ixr1 mediates the DNA replication stress response through it HMGB DNA binding domains and interaction with checkpoint Mrc1","authors":"Zhang, X.; Teng, S.; Wang, Y.; Jiang, J.; Li, M.; Liu, Y.; Guan, Y.; Wei, A.; Cong, Z.","author_corresponding":"Xinmin Zhang","author_corresponding_institution":".Department of Regenerative Medicine, School of Pharmaceutical Science, Jilin University, Changchun 130021, China","date":"2023-06-01","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_no","category":"genetics","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2023\/06\/01\/2023.05.30.542938.source.xml","abstract":"Background: High mobility group box (HMGB) family protein Ixr1 has been shown to be involved in DNA damage repair, however, its role and mechanism remain largely unclear. Methods: Genes of S. cerevisiae were deleted or tagged with myc, GFP, or mcherry using the lithium acetate method. Sensitivity of strains to hydroxyurea (HU), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), camptothe-cin (CPT), 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4-NQ), or Zeocin was tested. Distribution of GFP or mcherry fusion proteins was visualized with laser scanning confocal microscopy. RNA-seq was used to determine differential gene expression between mutant and control strains. Results: Ixr1 deletion (ixr1) mutant strain was sensitive to HU. Additionally, phosphorylation of effector of DNA damage checkpoint kinase Rad53 was lower in ixr1 than WT. Deletion of DNA damage checkpoint mediators ixr1 Rad9 was more sensitive to HU than ixr1 or Rad9, and ixr1 mrc1 had similar sensitivity to HU as mrc1 but stronger than ixr1. Deletion of ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors sml1 or crt10 didnt reduce the sensitivity of ixr1 induced by HU. Repli-cation fork nuclease exo1 ixr1 or helicase sgs1 ixr1 double deletions were more sensitive to HU than single deletion. In addition, laser scanning confocal microscopy imaging indicated that in response to HU, Ixr1 may be in the same pathway as Mrc1, possibly downstream. Gene Ontol-ogy enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ixr1 and wildtype, untreated and treated with HU, confirmed that Ixr1 plays an important role in regulating the transcription of genes related to DNA replication or DNA damage repair. We also found that, re-gardless of HU exposure, Ixr1 localized to the nucleus and may bind DNA through its two HMG-boxes. Conclusion: Ixr1 participates in the DNA replication stress response through a DNA damage checkpoint pathway mediated by Mrc1, and regulates expression of genes related to DNA damage repair.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543164","title":"Cyanide-dependent control of terminal oxidase hybridization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa MpaR","authors":"Smiley, M.

It produces four different types of terminal oxidases for aerobic respiration, and for one of these - the cbb3-type terminal oxidases - it has the capacity to produce at least 16 isoforms encoded by partially redundant operons. It also produces small-molecule virulence factors that interact with the respiratory chain, including the poison cyanide. Previous studies had indicated a role for cyanide in activating expression of an \"orphan\" terminal oxidase subunit gene called ccoN4 and that the product contributes to P. aeruginosa cyanide resistance, fitness in biofilms, and virulence-but the mechanisms underlying this process had not been elucidated. Here, we show that the regulatory protein MpaR, which is predicted to be a pyridoxal phosphate-binding transcription factor and is encoded just upstream of ccoN4, controls ccoN4 expression in response to endogenous cyanide. Paradoxically, we find that cyanide production is required to support CcoN4s contribution to respiration in biofilms. We identify a palindromic motif required for cyanide- and MpaR-dependent expression of ccoN4 and co-expressed, adjacent loci. We also characterize the regulatory logic of this region of the chromosome. Finally, we identify residues in the putative cofactor-binding pocket of MpaR that are required for ccoN4 expression. Together, our findings illustrate a novel scenario in which the respiratory toxin cyanide acts as a signal to control gene expression in a bacterium that produces the compound endogenously.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.30.542751","title":"A framework for identifying fertility gene targets for mammalian pest control","authors":"Clark, A.

To overcome these issues we developed P-DOR, a novel tool for rapid bacterial outbreak characterization. P-DOR accepts genome assemblies as input, it automatically selects a background of publicly available genomes using k-mer distances and adds it to the analysis dataset before inferring a SNP-based phylogeny. Epidemiological clusters are identified considering the phylogenetic tree topology and SNP distances. By analyzing the SNP-distance distribution, the user can gauge the correct threshold. Patient metadata can be inputted as well, to provide a spatio-temporal representation of the outbreak. The entire pipeline is fast and scalable and can be also run on low-end computers.\n\nAvailability and implementationP-DOR is implemented in Python3 and R and can be installed using conda environments.

One way to increase pathogen suppression would be the addition of soil organic amendments, however the mechanism behind this effect remains unexplored. The presented study will focus on Rhizoctonia solani disease in sugar beet grown in two different soils. We aim to find how microbial communities and their molecular functions can be linked to Rhizoctonia solani disease suppression in sugar beet seedlings after soil is amended with a keratin-rich side stream from the farming industry. Amended soil samples were analyzed using shotgun metagenomics sequencing, and the disease score of plants infected with Rhizoctonia and grown in the same soil was collected. Results showed that both keratin-rich amended soils were rich in bacteria from the Flavobacteriaceae, Sphingobacteriaceae, Boseaceae, Phyllobacteriaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, Rhodanobacteraceae and Steroidobacteraceae, as well as taxa from the phylum Bdellovibrionota, containing obligate predatory bacteria. The only fungal group that increased significantly was the Mortierellaceae family. Keratinases were abundant in the keratin-rich amended samples. Pfam domain enrichment analysis showed a decline in domains that could be annotated in both keratin-rich amended soils (Lisse [~]18% and Vredepeel [~]30%), showing an increase in unknown proteins. Among proteins that were enriched were those potentially involved in the production of secondary metabolites\/antibiotics, proteins involved in motility, keratin-degradation, and contractile secretion system proteins (mostly type VI secretion system). These results could show that keratin-rich soil amendments can support the transformation into a disease suppressive soil by stimulating the same taxa that have been found in other disease suppressive soils. We hypothesize that these taxa are responsible for the suppression effect due to their genomic potential to produce antibiotics, secrete effectors via the contractile secretion system, and degrade oxalate, which is considered a virulence factor of R. solani, while simultaneously possessing the ability to metabolize keratin.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2023.05.31.543096","title":"Wolbachia-induced inhibition of O'nyong nyong virus in Anopheles mosquitoes is mediated by Toll signaling and modulated by cholesterol","authors":"Pujhari, S.; Hughes, G.

Using an Anopheles mosquito - somatic Wolbachia infection - O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV) model, we demonstrate that the mechanism underpinning Wolbachia-mediated virus inhibition is up-regulation of the Toll innate immune pathway. However, the viral inhibitory properties of Wolbachia were abolished by cholesterol supplementation. This result was due to Wolbachia-dependent cholesterol-mediated suppression of Toll signaling rather than competition for cholesterol between Wolbachia and virus. The inhibitory effect of cholesterol was specific to Wolbachia-infected Anopheles mosquitoes and cells. These data indicate that both Wolbachia and cholesterol influence Toll immune signaling in Anopheles mosquitoes in a complex manner and provide a functional link between the host immunity and metabolic competition hypotheses for explaining Wolbachia-mediated pathogen interference in mosquitoes. In addition, these results provide a mechanistic understanding of the mode of action of Wolbachia-induced pathogen blocking in Anophelines, which is critical to evaluate the long-term efficacy of control strategies for malaria and Anopheles-transmitted arboviruses.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"}]}
